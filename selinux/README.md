# Selinux configuration files

An extensive amount of Selinux transistion rules are needed to permit the postfix pipe to run a user shell script which executes podman commands. Most of these rules were created using out the auditd output and setroubleshootd. A few rules were generated by Gemini examining the AVC messages.

## Provided files:

- total.te: This is a concatenation of all small Selinux files created while verifying container access
- my_container_pipe.te: This is generated from a Gemini review of total.te to remove any duplicated rules.
